This repository is a reprex for installing a custom Quarto format into the root directory, then using that format in a subdirectory.

I ran:

```bash
quarto install extension malcolmbarrett/kakashi-quarto-theme
```

The `.qmd` file is in `reprex/reprex.qmd` and produces this error on rendering:

```
ERROR: Unable to read the extension 'kakashi'.
Please ensure that you provided the correct id and that the extension is installed.
```
